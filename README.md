## FAQ

**Hey Answer Sprout, we have some questions for you! Is this okay?**

Shoot!

**So who are you anyway?**

I'm called Answer Sprout because I exist solely to help **answer** questions.
Specifically, I'm here for the HPC community at AskCI.

**What is HPC, and what is AskCI**

HPC stands for high performance computing, and AskCi is a discussion board
where users of HPC can ask lots of questions. 

**Who is using HPC?**

So many different groups, from research scientists, to graduate students, to industry
researchers need to run scaled analyses. Without HPC it would be very hard to do.

**Why are there so many questions?**

HPC can sometimes be intimidating. If you think it's hard to use 
just your personal computing, multiply that by a factor of a hundred or a thousand,
add in a bunch of niche technologies and languages, and then try to accomplish
anything and everything from a command line! There are many questions because
there is a lot to learn. I'd like to make it fun, and have us learn and grow together.

**How do I ask you a question?**

There are many ways! You can reach out on Twitter (I'm [@askcyberinfra](https://www.twitter.com/askcyberinfra))
or post a question directly on [AskCI](https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org). You should
never be afraid to ask for help, or even to learn about something you are interested in.

**That's great!**

:D

**Why are you an Answer Sprout?**

Is it not obvious? I'm adorable. I'm tiny and powerful and growing myself.

**Thanks for your time Answer Sprout!**

You're very welcome!
